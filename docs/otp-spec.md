# OTP Beyond Borders — Specification

## 1. Source document

An airline OTP ("On-Time Performance") target guide — three poster variants (A380, Wide Body excluding A380, Narrow Body) each showing turnaround milestone targets as negative minutes before STD (Scheduled Time of Departure). The timings bundled with the app are a seed; replace them with your operator's current revision before shipping.

Every poster shows four horizontal swim lanes (ENGINEER, GROUND, CABIN, PILOTS) converging on a vertical dashed line labeled STD on the right. Milestones appear as numbered circles above and below the swim lanes, with colored outlines indicating the responsible role.

## 2. Roles & color coding

| Role | Color (approx) | Typical milestones |
|---|---|---|
| **ENGINEER** | Dark teal | Shared circles on Wide Body / A380 posters |
| **GROUND** | Terracotta / coral | Equipment connect, auto-boarding, GPU/ACU off, tow truck |
| **CABIN** | Gold / mustard | Auto-boarding (shared), doors closed (shared) |
| **PILOTS** | Navy | Briefing, bus, board, pre-flight, loadsheet, eATL, doors closed (shared) |

Circles with multi-colored outlines = shared responsibility. Example: "Doors Closed" outline shows Cabin + Pilots + Ground.

## 3. Milestones by aircraft

All values are minutes before STD. "Owner" = which swim lane primarily executes.

### 3.1 A380

- **Total OTP window**: 1:45 (standard) / 1:55 (US-CBP) — reporting time = STD − 105 / 115 min
- **US-CBP adjustment**: +10 minutes to CBC briefing and bus departure only
- **Bus briefing note**: Remainder of briefing to be conducted in the bus

| T−min | T−min (CBP) | Milestone | Owner(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| −98 | −108 | CBC Briefing Completed | Pilots / Cabin |
| −88 | −98 | Bus Departs CBC | Pilots / Cabin |
| −73 | — | Board the Aircraft | Pilots / Cabin |
| −60 | — | Ground Equipment Connected | Ground |
| −55 | — | Pre-Flight Checks Completed | Pilots |
| −45 | — | Auto Boarding Initiated | Ground / Cabin |
| −40 | — | Prel-Loadsheet & Fuel Figures Passed | Pilots |
| −15 | — | eATL Signed & Briefing Completed | Pilots |
| −10 | — | Loadsheet Received | Pilots |
| −10 | — | GPU/ACU Disconnected | Ground |
| −5 | — | Doors Closed | Cabin + Pilots + Ground |
| −5 | — | Tow Truck Connected | Ground |

### 3.2 Wide Body (A350, B777, B787)

- **Total OTP window**: 1:30 (standard) / 1:45 (US-CBP) — reporting time = STD − 90 / 105 min
- **US-CBP adjustment**: +15 minutes to CBC briefing and bus departure only
- **LRV**: no timeline change — same 1:30 window applies for both NON-LRV and LRV

| T−min | T−min (CBP) | Milestone | Owner(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| −85 | −100 | CBC Briefing Completed | Pilots / Cabin |
| −75 | −90 | Bus Departs CBC | Pilots / Cabin |
| −60 | — | Ground Equipment Connected | Ground |
| −60 | — | Board the Aircraft | Pilots / Cabin |
| −45 | — | Pre-Flight Checks Completed | Pilots |
| −45 | — | Auto Boarding Initiated | Ground / Cabin |
| −40 | — | Prel-Loadsheet & Fuel Figures Passed | Pilots |
| −15 | — | eATL Signed & Briefing Completed | Pilots |
| −10 | — | Loadsheet Received | Pilots |
| −10 | — | GPU/ACU Disconnected | Ground |
| −5 | — | Doors Closed | Cabin + Pilots + Ground |
| −5 | — | Tow Truck Connected | Ground |

### 3.3 Narrow Body (A320, A321)

- **Total OTP window**: not explicitly stated on poster; reporting time at T−70 implies ~1:10 window
- **No US-CBP variant** (narrow body is typically not deployed on AUH–US routes)
- **Sequence note**: Pre-flight checks complete at T−35, AFTER prel-loadsheet at T−40. This is the confirmed sequence for narrow body — visually the poster shows −35 before −40 along the horizontal axis, but the times are authoritative.

| T−min | Milestone | Owner(s) |
|---|---|---|
| −70 | CBC Briefing Completed | Pilots / Cabin |
| −63 | Bus Departs CBC | Pilots / Cabin |
| −60 | Ground Equipment Connected | Ground |
| −48 | Board the Aircraft | Pilots / Cabin |
| −40 | Prel-Loadsheet & Fuel Figures Passed | Pilots |
| −35 | Pre-Flight Checks Completed | Pilots |
| −35 | Auto Boarding Initiated | Ground / Cabin |
| −15 | eATL Signed & Briefing Completed | Pilots |
| −10 | Loadsheet Received | Pilots |
| −10 | GPU/ACU Disconnected | Ground |
| −5 | Doors Closed | Cabin + Pilots + Ground |
| −5 | Tow Truck Connected | Ground |

## 4. US-CBP airports

Bundled list in [../data/us_cbp_airports.json](../data/us_cbp_airports.json). Current as of April 2026:

- JFK — New York John F. Kennedy
- ORD — Chicago O'Hare
- BOS — Boston Logan
- IAD — Washington Dulles
- ATL — Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson
- CLT — Charlotte Douglas (from 4 May 2026)

Canadian destinations (YYZ Toronto, YYC Calgary from 2026) do NOT trigger CBP — they count as standard non-CBP North American flights.

The user can manually override CBP on/off per flight.

## 5. LRV (Long Range Variation)

Reference: Flight Time Limitation (FTL) variation for operations with sectors planned outside the prescriptive FTL regulation. Not an OTP parameter.

- **Variation A**: flights with one sector inside and one outside the prescriptive FTL scheme; Flight Duty Period up to 15 hours.
- **Variation B**: flights with all sectors outside the prescriptive scheme; FDP up to 19 hours.

OTP timeline is identical for NON-LRV and LRV on the Wide Body poster. The app accepts this metadata if available (for informational display) but does not use it for countdown computation.

## 6. Countdown logic (pseudocode)

```
inputs:
  reportingUTC   ← from calendar notes
  stdUTC         ← from calendar notes
  aircraftCategory ← detected or user-chosen (A380 / widebody / narrowbody)
  isUSCBP        ← derived from destination IATA, user-overridable

timeline = load("timelines/" + category + ".json")
now = current_time()

for m in timeline.milestones:
  t_minus = (m.cbp_t_minus if isUSCBP and m.cbp_t_minus else m.t_minus)
  m.target_time = stdUTC - t_minus * 60

next_milestone   = first m in timeline where m.target_time > now AND not m.user_marked_done
remaining_to_next = next_milestone.target_time - now
remaining_to_std  = stdUTC - now
elapsed_window   = now - reportingUTC
total_window     = stdUTC - reportingUTC
pct_elapsed      = clamp(elapsed_window / total_window, 0.0, 1.0)
```

## 7. Delay tracking

Once `now > stdUTC` AND `doors_closed` milestone not marked complete:

- Widget shows a "Log Delay" affordance (red badge).
- Main app opens a delay sheet on tap:
  - Minutes delayed (stepper)
  - IATA delay code picker (00–99), with code descriptions bundled as `data/iata_delay_codes.json` (TBD).
- Record persists per flight in iCloud for the user's own reference.

## 8. Widget (iPhone rectangular lock-screen)

Layout, top to bottom:

1. **Flight header** — `EY21  AUH → YYZ  A380` (flight, route, aircraft chip)
2. **Current phase name** — e.g., "Pre-Flight Checks"
3. **Countdown to next milestone** — large type, `MM:SS` or `H:MM`
4. **Thin progress bar** — elapsed of OTP window, with tick marks at each upcoming milestone
5. **Next milestone label** — e.g., "Prel-Loadsheet in 12m"

Progress-bar fill color = current owner's role color (pilots=navy, cabin=gold, ground=terracotta, engineer=teal). If shared ownership, use a two-tone gradient.

## 9. Apple Watch complication

- Circular progress around the watch face (elapsed % of OTP window)
- Center: countdown to next milestone
- Tap → open app

## 10. Onboarding flow

1. Welcome + brand
2. Role picker: Pilot / Cabin / Engineer / Ground (illustrated carousel — needs design)
3. Calendar access request + explainer: "Your rostering or crew-control app → Settings → Export to Calendar"
4. Notification permission (silent default + explainer)
5. Language choice (default = device language)
6. Demo flight ("Tap to see how it works")

## 11. Non-goals for v1

See [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for the authoritative list.
